v0.2.0 - Generate imported source file instead of data file

Improved build systems optimize for size and as a result have
complex pruning practices for builds. It would appear the latest
revision of Remix includes some updates to the build procedure which
prevents data.enc files from being included.

Again, in following behind Prisma, I've decided to generate an actual JS
file instead and import it inside the code. This way build systems must
include the file and it will not be pruned.
